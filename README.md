The Community A-4E-C represents more than three years of work on behalf of the development team. We’re proud to present the most comprehensive DCS World module to date, boasting such capabilities as air-to-ground radar and carrier operations. The A-4 was a cold war workhorse, providing a capable, reliable light attack aircraft to dozens of nations around the world. From the Sinai Desert to the Jungles of Vietnam, the A-4 was a common sight above cold war battlefields.

We thank the DCS World community for their support over the years, and dedicate the module to our friend, mentor and lead coder, Eric “Gospadin” Mudama. His passion and brilliance left a mark on us all, and this labor of love which would not have been possible without him.

### Known Bugs

#### Dispensing high volumes of bomblets (40+) from SUU-7/CBU-1/CBU-2 causes serious performance dip and/or crashes to desktop

- Drop bomblets in lower release settings via the kneeboard or mission editor

#### TrackIR becomes non-functional when loading into different aircraft cockpits

- This tends only to happen in single player games. Restart DCS World

#### Some aircraft systems are non-functional

- Certain systems are either unimplemented or unable to be replicated by the developers at this time. These include, but are not limited to radio, in-flight refueling, D-704 Buddy refueling pod, and Walleye guided missiles.

## Installation

Download the latest A-4E-C installation file from the [releases page](https://github.com/heclak/community-a4e-c/releases/)

Unzip the contents of the zip file into the following folder: `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS`

**NOTE: The mod MUST be installed into this folder, EVEN if you have installed DCS into a different folder than default.**

**FAILURE TO DO SO WILL CAUSE THE MOD TO NOT WORK AND WILL CAUSE YOUR CLIENT TO FAIL THE IC CHECK**

If you are installing onto an openbeta client the path changes to: `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta`

Note: The above does not apply to steam clients, they are still installed into: `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS`

_To assist OvGME and JSGME users, we’ve included the “mods/aircraft/” folders in the zip. You can safely merge these folders with your DCS World user folder._

### Updating to the latest version

To update your A-4E-C to the latest version. You **must delete** the currently installed A-4E-C folder before placing the new version in its place. This is to remove any old files that are no longer used in the updated version. Not doing so will cause problems with your installation.

## Troubleshooting

If you have used multiple instances of DCS World (especially users who have used DCS_updater.exe to change versions of their installation), you may need to experiment to locate the correct DCS World user folder, e.g. `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS`

The correct folder might not match the version of DCS World you are using. You can quickly identify which folder is in use by your computer by launching DCS world, creating and saving a mission file in the mission editor and noting its file name and location.

Do not attempt to install the A-4E-C module files directly into your DCS World installation folder. This will cause the A-4E-C to fail, and your client will fail any file integrity checks made by multiplayer servers!
